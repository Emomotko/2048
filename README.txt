You are going to play 2048 game. Let's look at the description of the
game and follow the instructions described below.

2048 game was created  in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer
Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on
a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game,
you are going to play in enhanced version of the original one.

Let's start the game by writing /2048.py in the terminal. The main window
will appear with the Manubar and the button Start.

You are able to set some options in the game to make it more difficult
or easier (it depends on your preferences). In the manubar, you can find
File and About menus. Firstly, let's check the first one and then select
Options. The options window will appear.

In the first tab you can set some options related to the game itself. 
You can choose the height of the plane(as it is in the original version,
 the plane is squared) and the level of the game. The level of difficulty 
indicates how many "dummy" tiles are present in the plane. These "dummy" 
tiles are ones, that will not sum up.Their numbers remains unchanged during
the game.

In the second tab you can choose what design of the game you prefer: the dark one
or maybe tha fair one.

When you choose APPLY button all the options are going to be used in the game.

By choosing exit option in the menu bar, you can easily leave the game.

Another menu in the main window is the Help Menu. There is only one option 
availabe there (About). When you select this option the window with the short
description of the game will appear. However, all necessary information can be
found here in the README.txt document.

You can start the game by clicking START button in the main window. The plane
will be created according to the options you have selected earlier. If you are
not satisfied with the level of the game you can change it whenever you want,
the plane is then created from scratch. If you have no move or you want to
restart the game, press S key.

The rules are simple: use Y, G, H, B keys in order to slide the tiles. If the
tiles with the same number (which is always the power of 2) meet, then they are
merged into one tile with the number which is the sum of the previous ones.
If there is any possible move the game will last, otherwise if you have won
Dialog Window will appear with the appropiate message. If you have no other
move, then press S key to restart the game or click EXIT button to leave the game.

ATTENTION! Before you start the game from the console, please change the initial
path to ipython in each if the .py files.
